 * Why: a TextureView destroys its SurfaceTexture whenever it leaves the window (moving it
 * from the full player to the mini-player does exactly that). The decoder then loses its
 * output, is rebuilt, and waits for the next keyframe — seconds of frozen picture, the
 * "flash" when minimizing. Here the SurfaceTexture is never released (the destroy callback
 * returns false) and is handed back to whichever TextureView shows the video next, so the
 * player's surface never changes and playback never notices a move.
